### ðŸ§¬ ABUS: Adaptability, Bioinformatics, and Usability Score

**ABUS** is a structured scoring and recommendation framework designed to evaluate **Protein Language Models (PLMs)** based on their:

* **Adaptability** to new tasks or data
* **Bioinformatics relevance** for biological applications
* **Usability** for researchers and developers

The ABUS framework provides a fair, interpretable, and feature-driven scoring system to rank and recommend PLMs for bioinformatics use cases. It supports custom scoring profiles, visualization, and comparison tools to streamline PLM selection for your research.
